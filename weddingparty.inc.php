<p>I first met Marc in College  at the University of Northern Iowa where we became fast friends in the  Dormatory. We lived together in the &quot;Bat House&quot; and had many adventures  during the 2 years we were Founding fathers of the first chapter of Pi  Kappa Phi Fraternity. Although the fraternity never officially  chartered we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of great memories and have still been great  friends ever since. </p>
