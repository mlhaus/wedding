    <h3>About the Bride  </h3>

    <p><img class="party" src="images/engagement01.jpg" alt="Amy Pasternak and Marc Hauschildt" width="200" height="179" /></p>

    <p>Amy was born and raised in Indianapolis,   IN. She was uprooted from the Hoosier state  and forced into Nebraska in 1994.  She graduated from UNO in May 2004, and began working in the accounting  department at Lozier Store Fixtures in Omaha.  She graduated from Bellevue University  in March of 2007. After spending the second half of her life thus far in Omaha,  Amy moved to Iowa City, IA  in April of 2007, and worked for 3 looooong months as the cost accountant at  the Donaldson plant in Grinnell, IA.  Amy is currently the cost accountant at Clipper Turbine Works plant in Cedar    Rapids, IA. </p>

    <p>Amy loves football season. Amy has married into Hawkeye  football, and is excited to tailgate with Marc and friends. This fall ('07) was  especially exciting because it was the first year we bought season tickets. But,  Amy is really passionate about Notre Dame football, and not just because of the  movie Rudy, although it is a bonus! Don&rsquo;t mention the 1993 Boston   College game, unless you want an  earful. She has also been a Colts fan since they moved to Indy in 1984. She can  remember who the quarterbacks were in years where they couldn&rsquo;t give away  enough tickets to fill the Hoosier Dome (now RCA Dome). And yes&hellip; the 2007 AFC  Championship game was a dream come true&hellip; and a Super Bowl title wasn &rsquo;t too shabby  either! </p>

    <p>Amy&rsquo;s brother is a CPA in Omaha,  where Amy&rsquo;s mom also lives. Her dad works in the travel industry out of his  home office in Phoenix. </p>
